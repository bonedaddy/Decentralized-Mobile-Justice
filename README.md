# decentralized-police-enforcement

This repo will contain code for an application that acts as a wrapper to the phone call function, whenever 911 is dailed both the front, and back, cameras of the phone will be turned on to record sound and video.
All this will be stored on decentralized filesystems like IPFS. When the file is saved on the decentralized storage system, and checksum is performed onthe file and that checksum is then stored on the Ethereum blockchain, where it will be immutable.
This way anyone can verify tha authenticity of the file on IPFS by comparing the checksum with the one listed in Ethereum.
