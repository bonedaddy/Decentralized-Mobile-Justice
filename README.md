# Decentralized Mobile Justice 

This project is still in development (including the readme file) so only very basic security checks.  A proffesional contract auditor will be seeked out at the appropriate time

Several years ago there was a project done along with ACLU (around the time of the Eric Gardner police brutality case) to build a system where users could stream footage a police incident, and store it locally on their phone, but also stream it to remote servers in case the phone was compromised and video evidence deleted. This was a great project but it suffered from one problem: centralization. For whatever reason it appears the project is now defunct, so in essence this is a reboot of that project, but instead of storing the data on central servers, it will be stores usaing a distributed, and decentralized filesystem protocol called IPFS (this may change in the future) to store the data. This data will then be checksumed, and the checksum will be uploaded to the ethereum blockchain in an immutable storage container of a smart contract this way when viewing the video you can run a checksum, and compare the hash with a known good, and non-changeable hash which will help verify video authenticity (this verification system will likely change and become more advanced as time goes on)

It will feature a token based incentive system for contributing to the network, whether it be recording incidences, or running oine of the servers that receives a video stream. 


# Project Road Map

As of this moment, there is no set roadmap with specific dates. However this is an open-source, and volunteer based project where anyone is allowed to contribute. Once there is a fully working prototype, I will be crowdfunding this project so that I can hire developers so we can churn out a production ready product. Everyone who was part of the project during the initial (current) development phase, will be offered a paid development position, with pay equivalent to the work done.

There is also the possibility to help use mhe platform to raise awarenes of human abuse cases and corruption but that is something which if implemented will come much later.

# Positions which volunteers are needed to fill

* QA testers
* Go programmer
* Mobile Application Developer
* Frontend developer
* Website designer

Should you wish to develop, please submit a pull request from the solidity branch and describe your intentions on how you plan to contribute to the project.

Note that for the moment, any of the smart contract development is being limited to the Founder, and co-founder of the project. All code written will always be publicly viewable at anytime.
