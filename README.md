# decentralized-police-enforcement

The idea for this Dapp is to build out a system to enable the automatic, and fair recording of police encounters withe public to ensure justic is met in cases of police brutally.  There will be a phone application that serves as a wrapper around the ability for video recording to be automatically enabled when a the emergency line is called (this is an optional feature and requires the user to specifically enable it)

The main functionality comes with the ability to record, and stream video to a Dapp which downloads the streamed video footage, uploading it to a decentralized storage system called IPFS. Code then generates a checksum of the video, storing it in an immutable data tracking smart contract, which will be used to keep a list of all videos that are uploaded to IPFS, and their hash so that authenticity of the video can be be verified.

This project is not cmplete and is in it's very early stages.
